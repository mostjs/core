``@most/core`` is a toolkit for reactive programming.  It helps you write highly interactive apps by composing streams of events, and without many of the hazards of side effects and mutable shared state.

It features an ultra-high performance, low overhead architecture, and a small but powerful set of operations for merging, filtering, and transforming event streams.
