## Context

While streams solve many issues, working with streams have a particular
pain-point when it comes to debugging them. Aforementioned is especially true
when the complexity of an application increases.

Presently, we must resort to using `observe`, often with a console log, to
inspect the values of a stream. We end up with these `observe`s cluttered all
over the place in our effort to track down a possible bug or issue, which we
then have to remove again once resolved. Debugging with `observe` also doesn’t
provide any particularly useful feedback on dataflow nor combinators used.

To alleviate this, it is essential that external tools can gain access to
expecting the details of streams. Currently, there is no hook to accomplishing
this, wherefore this document will attempt to uncover a reasonable way of
doing so.

How such a hook should be implemented came down to the following choices:

1.  **Add a third hook parameter to `Stream.run`.**

    * A third parameter may be okay if we provide a sensible default value
      because it won’t break clients’ existing runtime code. Thus, we can be
      backward compatible.

    * It may not be okay because we are reaching the limit of parameters for what
      is acceptable for a function. Three parameters introduce a mental overhead
      for developers because they have to remember the order of the parameters.

    * It may also not be okay because the new type this change could break the
      static type-checking of existing code.

2.  **Add a new run-like method `Stream` with a third hook parameter.**

    * A new run-like method with a third hook parameter may be okay because it
      leaves the existing `Stream.run()` method intact and could perhaps be
      implemented in a non-breaking fashion.

    * It may not be okay because it will require clients to call a different
      `run()` method to use the hook.

3.  **Add a new run-like method to `Stream` with a row-like "resources" parameter.**

    * A new run-like method with a row-like "resources" parameter may be okay
      because it makes it easy to add new rows in the future.

    * It may not be okay because we don’t have concrete use cases for it right
      now, and we don’t know if it’s the future direction we’ll choose for the
      next major version.
