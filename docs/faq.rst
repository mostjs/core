**What's the relationship between most 1.0 and @most/core?**

@most/core is a new implementation of most's architecture, based on lessons learned from building and maintaining most. It has a leaner API that is more tailored to a functional style of programming.

Most 2.0 will be implemented on top of @most/core.

If you're starting a new project and @most/core's leaner API and programming style fit your goals, we recommend starting with it rather than most.
