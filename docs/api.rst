.. _Time:

Time
^^^^

.. code-block:: haskell

  type Time = number

Time is a monotonic number. It represents the current time according to a :ref:`Scheduler`. The default :ref:`Scheduler` uses ``performance.now`` in browsers and ``process.hrtime`` (transformed to a `number`) in Node.

.. code-block:: haskell

  type Delay = number
  type Period = number
  type Offset = number

``Delay``, ``Period``, and ``Offset`` are semantic time-related types. They're all numbers but are intended to provide helpful semantics for working with :ref:`Task` and  :ref:`Scheduler` methods.

.. _Stream:

Stream
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: haskell

  type Stream a = {
    run :: Sink a -> Scheduler -> Disposable
  }

A ``Stream`` represents a view of events over time. Its ``run`` method arranges events to be propagated to the provided :ref:`Sink` in the future. Each ``Stream`` has a local clock, defined by the provided :ref:`Scheduler`, which has methods for knowing the current time and scheduling future :ref:`Task`s.

Some ``Stream``s, like :ref:`now`, are simple, while others, like :ref:`combine`, do sophisticated things such as combining multiple ``Stream``s or dealing with higher-order ``Stream``s.

Some ``Stream``s act as event producers, such as from DOM events. A producer ``Stream`` must never produce an event in the same call stack as its ``run`` method is called. It must begin producing items asynchronously. In some cases, this comes for free, such as DOM events. In other cases, it must be done explicitly using the provided ref:`Scheduler` to schedule asynchronous ref:`Task`s.

.. _Sink:

Sink
^^^^

.. code-block:: haskell

  type Sink a = {
    event :: Time -> a -> void
    error :: Time -> Error -> void
    end :: Time -> void
  }

A ``Sink`` receives events—typically it does something with them, such as transforming or filtering them—and then propagates them to another ``Sink``.

Typically, a combinator will be implemented as a :ref:`Stream` and a ``Sink``. The :ref:`Stream` is usually stateless/immutable and creates a new ``Sink`` for each new observer. In most cases, the relationship of a :ref:`Stream` to ``Sink`` is 1-many.

.. _Disposable:

Disposable
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: haskell

  type Disposable = {
    dispose:: () -> void
  }

A ``Disposable`` represents a resource that must be disposed of (or released), such as a DOM event listener.

.. _Scheduler:

Scheduler
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: haskell

  type Scheduler = {
    currentTime :: () -> Time
    scheduleTask :: Offset -> Delay -> Period -> Task -> ScheduledTask
    relative :: Offset -> Scheduler
    cancel :: ScheduledTask -> void
    cancelAll :: (ScheduledTask -> boolean) -> void
  }

A ``Scheduler`` provides the central notion of time for the :ref:`Stream`s in an application.

An application will typically create a single "root" ``Scheduler`` so that all :ref:`Stream`s share the same underlying time.

.. _Clock:

Clock
^^^^^

.. code-block:: haskell

  type Clock = {
    now :: () -> Time
  }

A ``Clock`` represents a source of the current time.

.. _Timer:

Timer
^^^^^

.. code-block:: haskell

  type Handle = any -- intentionally opaque handle

  type Timer = {
    now :: () -> Time,
    setTimer :: (() -> any) -> Delay -> Handle,
    clearTimer :: Handle -> void
  }

A ``Timer`` abstracts platform time, typically relying on a :ref:`Clock`, and timer scheduling, typically using ``setTimeout``.

.. _Timeline:

Timeline
^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: haskell

  type TaskRunner = (ScheduledTask) -> any

  type Timeline = {
    add :: ScheduledTask -> void,
    remove :: ScheduledTask -> boolean,
    removeAll :: (ScheduledTask) -> boolean) -> void,
    isEmpty :: () -> boolean,
    nextArrival :: () -> Time,
    runTasks :: Time -> TaskRunner -> void
  }

A ``Timeline`` represents a set of :ref:`ScheduledTask`s to be executed at particular times.

.. _Task:

Task
^^^^

.. code-block:: haskell

  type Task = Disposable & {
    run :: Time -> void,
    error:: Time -> Error -> void
  }

A ``Task`` is any unit of work that can be scheduled for execution with a :ref:`Scheduler`.

ScheduledTask
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: haskell

  type ScheduledTask = Disposable & {
    task :: Task,
    run :: () -> void,
    error :: Error -> void
  }

A ``ScheduledTask`` represents a :ref:`Task` which has been scheduled in a particular :ref:`Scheduler`.  A ``ScheduledTask``'s ``dispose`` method will cancel the :ref:`Task` with the :ref:`Scheduler` with which it was scheduled.

.. _Running:

Running
^^^^^^^

.. _runEffects:

runEffects
``````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  runEffects :: Stream a -> Scheduler -> Promise void

Activate an event :ref:`Stream` and consume all its events.

Construction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _empty:

empty
`````

.. code-block:: haskell

  empty :: () -> Stream *

Create a :ref:`Stream` containing no events and ends immediately. ::

  empty(): |

.. _never:

never
`````

.. code-block:: haskell

  never :: () -> Stream *

Create a :ref:`Stream` containing no events and never ends. ::

  never(): ---->

.. _now:

now
```

.. code-block:: haskell

  now :: a -> Stream a

Create a :ref:`Stream` containing a single event at time 0. ::

  now(x): x|

.. _at:

at
``

.. code-block:: haskell

  at :: Time -> a -> Stream a

Create a :ref:`Stream` containing a single event at a specific time. ::

  at(3, x): --x|

.. _throwError:

throwError
``````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  throwError :: Error -> Stream void

Create a :ref:`Stream` that fails at time 0 with the provided ``Error``.

This can be useful for functions that need to return a :ref:`Stream` and also need to propagate an error. ::

  throwError(X): X

Extending
^^^^^^^^^

.. _startWith:

startWith
`````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  startWith :: a -> Stream a -> Stream a

Prepend an event at time 0. ::

  stream:               --a-b-c-d->
  startWith(x, stream): x-a-b-c-d->

Note that ``startWith`` *does not* delay other events. If ``stream`` already contains an event at time 0, then ``startWith`` simply adds another event at time 0—the two will be simultaneous, but ordered. For example::

  stream:                a-b-c-d->
  startWith(x, stream): xa-b-c-d->

Both ``x`` and ``a`` occur at time 0, but ``x`` will be observed before ``a``.

.. _continueWith:

continueWith
````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  continueWith :: (() -> Stream a) -> Stream a -> Stream a

Replace the end of a :ref:`Stream` with another :ref:`Stream`. ::

  stream:                  -a-b-c-d|
  f(): 		                         -1-2-3-4-5->
  continueWith(f, stream): -a-b-c-d-1-2-3-4-5->

When ``stream`` ends, ``f`` will be called and must return a :ref:`Stream`.

Transformation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
map
```

.. code-block:: haskell

  map :: (a -> b) -> Stream a -> Stream b

Apply a function to each event value. ::

  stream:         -a-b-c-d->
  map(f, stream): -f(a)-f(b)-f(c)-f(d)->

.. code-block:: javascript

  map(x => x + 1, stream)

.. _constant:

constant
````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  constant :: a -> Stream * -> Stream a

Replace each event value with ``x``. ::

  stream:              -a-b-c-d->
  constant(x, stream): -x-x-x-x->

.. code-block:: javascript

  constant('tick', periodic(1000))

.. _tap:

tap
```

.. code-block:: haskell

  tap :: (a -> *) -> Stream a -> Stream a

Perform a side effect for each event in a :ref:`Stream`.

.. code-block:: javascript

  stream:         -a-b-c-d->
  tap(f, stream): -a-b-c-d->

For each event in ``stream``, ``f`` is called, but the value of its result is ignored. If ``f`` fails (i.e., throws an error), then the returned :ref:`Stream` will also fail. The :ref:`Stream` returned by ``tap`` will contain the same events as the original :ref:`Stream`.

.. _ap:

ap
```

.. code-block:: haskell

  ap :: Stream (a -> b) -> Stream a -> Stream b

Apply the latest function in a :ref:`Stream` of functions to the latest value of another :ref:`Stream`.

.. code-block:: javascript

  streamOfFunctions:              --f-----------g---------h--------->
  stream:                         -a-------b---------c---------d---->
  ap(stream, streamOfFunctions.): --f(a)---f(b)-g(b)-g(c)-h(c)-h(d)->

In effect, ``ap`` applies a time-varying function to a time-varying value.

.. _scan:

scan
````

.. code-block:: haskell

  scan :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> Stream a -> Stream b

Incrementally accumulate results, starting with the provided initial value. ::

  stream:                           -1-2-3->
  scan((x, y) => x + y, 0, stream): 01-3-6->

.. _loop:

loop
````
.. code-block:: haskell

  loop :: (b -> a -> { seed :: b, value :: c }) -> b -> Stream a -> Stream c

Accumulate results using a feedback loop that emits one value and feeds back another to be used in the next iteration.

It allows you to maintain and update a "state" (a.k.a. feedback, a.k.a. seed for the next iteration) while emitting a different value. In contrast, :ref:`scan` feeds back and produces the same value.

.. code-block:: javascript

  // Average an array of values.
  const average = values =>
  	values.reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0) / values.length

  const stream = // ...

  // Emit the simple (i.e., windowed) moving average of the 10 most recent values.
  loop((values, x) => {
  	values.push(x)
  	values = values.slice(-10) // Keep up to 10 most recent
  	const avg = average(values)

  	// Return { seed, value } pair.
  	// seed will feed back into next iteration.
  	// value will be propagated.
  	return { seed: values, value: avg }
  }, [], stream)

.. _zipArrayValues:

zipArrayValues
``````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  zipArrayValues :: ((a, b) -> c) -> [a] -> Stream b -> Stream c

Apply a function to the latest event and the array value at the respective index. ::

  stream:                             --10---10---10---10---10--->
  array:                              [ 1, 2, 3 ]
  zipArrayValues(add, array, stream): --11---12---13|

The resulting :ref:`Stream` will contain the same number of events as the input :ref:`Stream`, or ``array.length`` events, whichever is less.

.. _withArrayValues:

withArrayValues
```````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  withArrayValues :: [a] -> Stream b -> Stream a

Replace each event value with the array value at the respective index. ::

  array:                          [ 1, 2, 3 ]
  stream:                         --x--x--x--x--x-->
  withArrayValues(array, stream): --1--2--3|

The resulting :ref:`Stream` will contain the same number of events as the input :ref:`Stream`, or ``array.length`` events, whichever is less.

Flattening
^^^^^^^^^^

.. _switchLatest:

switchLatest
````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  switchLatest :: Stream (Stream a) -> Stream a

Given a higher-order :ref:`Stream`, return a new :ref:`Stream` that adopts the behavior of (i.e., emits the events of) the most recent inner :ref:`Stream`. ::

  s:                    -a-b-c-d-e-f->
  t:                    -1-2-3-4-5-6->
  stream:               -s-----t----->
  switchLatest(stream): -a-b-c-4-5-6->

.. _join:

join
````

.. code-block:: haskell

  join :: Stream (Stream a) -> Stream a

Given a higher-order :ref:`Stream`, return a new :ref:`Stream` that merges all the inner :ref:`Stream`s as they arrive. ::

  s:             ---a---b---c---d-->
  t:             -1--2--3--4--5--6->
  stream:        -s------t--------->
  join(stream):  ---a---b--4c-5-d6->

.. _chain:

chain
`````

.. code-block:: haskell

  chain :: (a -> Stream b) -> Stream a -> Stream b

Transform each event in ``stream`` into a new :ref:`Stream`, and then merge each into the resulting :ref:`Stream`. Note that ``f`` must return a :ref:`Stream`. ::

  stream:            -a----b----c|
  f(a):               1--2--3|
  f(b):                    1----2----3|
  f(c):                           1-2-3|
  chain(f, stream):  -1--2-13---2-1-233|

.. _concatMap:

concatMap
`````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  concatMap :: (a -> Stream b) -> Stream a -> Stream b

Transform each event in ``stream`` into a :ref:`Stream`, and then concatenate each onto the end of the resulting :ref:`Stream`. Note that ``f`` must return a :ref:`Stream`.

The mapping function ``f`` is applied lazily. That is, ``f`` is called only once it is time to concatenate a new stream. ::

  stream:                -a----b----c|
  f(a):                   1--2--3|
  f(b):                        1----2----3|
  f(c):                               1-2-3|
  concatMap(f, stream):  -1--2--31----2----31-2-3|
  f called lazily:        ^      ^          ^

Note the difference between ``concatMap`` and ref:`chain`: ``concatMap`` concatenates, while ref:`chain` merges.

.. _mergeConcurrently:

mergeConcurrently
`````````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  mergeConcurrently :: int -> Stream (Stream a) -> Stream a

Given a higher-order :ref:`Stream`, return a new :ref:`Stream` that merges inner :ref:`Stream`s as they arrive up to the specified concurrency. Once concurrency number of :ref:`Stream`s are being merged, newly arriving :ref:`Stream`s will be merged after an existing one ends. ::

  s:                            --a--b--c--d--e-->
  t:                            --x------y|
  u:                            -1--2--3--4--5--6>
  stream:                       -s--t--u--------->
  mergeConcurrently(2, stream): --a--b--cy4d-5e-6>

Note that ``u`` is only merged after ``t`` ends because of the concurrency level of 2.

Note also that ``mergeConcurrently(Infinity, stream)`` is equivalent to ``join(stream)``.

To control concurrency, ``mergeConcurrently`` must maintain an internal queue of newly arrived :ref:`Stream`s. If new :ref:`Stream`s arrive faster than the concurrency level allows them to be merged, the internal queue will grow infinitely.

.. _mergeMapConcurrently:

mergeMapConcurrently
```````````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  mergeMapConcurrently :: (a -> Stream b) -> int -> Stream a -> Stream b

Lazily apply a function ``f`` to each event in a :ref:`Stream`, merging them into the resulting :ref:`Stream` at the specified concurrency. Once concurrency number of :ref:`Stream`s are being merged, newly arriving :ref:`Stream`s will be merged after an existing one ends. ::

  stream:                             --ab--c----d----->
  f(a):                               -1-2-3|
  f(b):                               -4-5-6----------->
  f(c):                               -7--------------->
  f(d):                               -1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8->
  mergeMapConcurently(f, 2, stream) : ---142536-7------>

Note that ``f(c)`` is only merged after ``f(a)`` ends.

Also note that ``f`` will not get called with ``d`` until either ``f(b)`` or ``f(c)`` ends.

To control concurrency, ``mergeMapConcurrently`` must maintain an internal queue of newly arrived :ref:`Stream`s. If new :ref:`Stream`s arrive faster than the concurrency level allows them to be merged, the internal queue will grow infinitely.

Merging
^^^^^^^

.. _merge:

merge
`````

.. code-block:: haskell

  merge :: Stream a -> Stream a -> Stream a

Create a new :ref:`Stream` containing events from two :ref:`Stream`s. ::

  s1:            -a--b----c--->
  s2:            --w---x-y--z->
  merge(s1, s2): -aw-b-x-yc-z->

Merging creates a new :ref:`Stream` containing all events from the two original :ref:`Stream`s without affecting the time of the events. You can think of the events from the input :ref:`Stream`s simply being interleaved into the new, merged :ref:`Stream`. A merged :ref:`Stream` ends when all of its input :ref:`Stream`s have ended.

.. _mergeArray:

mergeArray
``````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  mergeArray :: [ (Stream a) ] -> Stream a

Array form of :ref:`merge`. Create a new :ref:`Stream` containing all events from all :ref:`Stream`s in the array. ::

  s1:                       -a--b----c---->
  s2:                       --w---x-y--z-->
  s3:                       ---1---2----3->
  mergeArray([s1, s2, s3]): -aw1b-x2yc-z3->

.. _combine:

combine
```````

.. code-block:: haskell

  combine :: (a -> b -> c) -> Stream a -> Stream b -> Stream c

Apply a function to the most recent event from each :ref:`Stream` when a new event arrives on any :ref:`Stream`. ::

  s1:                   -0--1----2--->
  s2:                   --3---4-5--6->
  combine(add, s1, s2): --3-4-5-67-8->

Note that ``combine`` waits for at least one event to arrive on all input :ref:`Stream`s before it produces any events.

.. _combineArray:

combineArray
````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  combineArray :: ((a, b, ...) -> z) -> [ Stream a, Stream b, ... ] -> Stream z

Array form of :ref:`combine`. Apply a function to the most recent event from all :ref:`Stream`s when a new event arrives on any :ref:`Stream`. ::

  s1:                               -0--1----2->
  s2:                               --3---4-5-->
  s3:                               ---2---1--->
  combineArray(add3, [s1, s2, s3]): ---56-7678->

.. _zip:

zip
```

.. code-block:: haskell

  zip :: (a -> b -> c) -> Stream a -> Stream b -> Stream c

Apply a function to corresponding pairs of events from the inputs :ref:`Stream`s. ::

  s1:               -1--2--3--4->
  s2:               -1---2---3---4->
  zip(add, s1, s2): -2---4---6---8->

Zipping correlates by *index*-corresponding events from two input streams. Note that zipping a "fast" :ref:`Stream` and a "slow" :ref:`Stream` will cause buffering. Events from the fast :ref:`Stream` must be buffered in memory until an event at the corresponding index arrives on the slow :ref:`Stream`.

A zipped :ref:`Stream` ends when any one of its input :ref:`Stream`s ends.

.. _zipArray:

zipArray
````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  zipArray :: ((a, b, ...) -> z) -> [ Stream a, Stream b, ... ] -> Stream z

Array form of :ref:`zip`. Apply a function to corresponding events from all the inputs :ref:`Stream`s. ::

  s1:                           -1-2-3---->
  s2:                           -1--2--3-->
  s3:                           --1--2--3->
  zipArray(add3, [s1, s2, s3]): --3--6--9->

sample
``````

.. code-block:: haskell

  sample :: ((a, b) -> c) -> Stream a -> Stream b -> Stream c

For each event in a sampler :ref:`Stream`, apply a function to combine it with the most recent event in another :ref:`Stream`. The resulting :ref:`Stream` will contain the same number of events as the sampler :ref:`Stream`. ::

  s1:                       -1--2--3--4--5->
  sampler:                  -1-----2-----3->
  sample(sum, sampler, s1): -2-----5-----8->

  s1:                       -1-----2-----3->
  sampler:                  -1--2--3--4--5->
  sample(sum, sampler, s1): -2--3--5--6--8->

Note that ``sample`` produces a value only when an event arrives on the sampler.

Filtering
^^^^^^^^^

.. _filter:

filter
``````

.. code-block:: haskell

  filter :: (a -> bool) -> Stream a -> Stream a

Retain only events for which a predicate is truthy. ::

  stream:               -1-2-3-4->
  filter(even, stream): ---2---4->

.. _skipRepeats:

skipRepeats
```````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  skipRepeats :: Stream a -> Stream a

Remove adjacent repeated events. ::

  stream:              -1-2-2-3-4-4-5->
  skipRepeats(stream): -1-2---3-4---5->

Note that ``===`` is used to identify repeated items. To use a different comparison, use :ref:`skipRepeatsWith`.

.. _skipRepeatsWith:

skipRepeatsWith
```````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  skipRepeatsWith :: ((a, a) -> bool) -> Stream a -> Stream a

Remove adjacent repeated events, using the provided equality function to compare adjacent events. ::

  stream:                                    -a-b-B-c-D-d-e->
  skipRepeatsWith(equalsIgnoreCase, stream): -a-b---c-D---e->

The equals function should return ``true`` if the two values are equal, or ``false`` if they are not equal.

.. _slice:

Slicing
^^^^^^^

slice
`````

.. code-block:: haskell

  slice :: int -> int -> Stream a -> Stream a

Keep only events in a range, where *start <= index < end*, and *index* is the ordinal index of an event in ``stream``. ::

  stream:              -a-b-c-d-e-f->
  slice(1, 4, stream): ---b-c-d|

  stream:              -a-b-c|
  slice(1, 4, stream): ---b-c|

If ``stream`` contains fewer than *start* events, the returned :ref:`Stream` will be empty.

.. _take:

take
````

.. code-block:: haskell

  take :: int -> Stream a -> Stream a

Keep at most the first *n* events from ``stream``. ::

  stream:          -a-b-c-d-e-f->
  take(3, stream): -a-b-c|

  stream:          -a-b|
  take(3, stream): -a-b|

If ``stream`` contains fewer than *n* events, the returned :ref:`Stream` will effectively be equivalent to ``stream``.

.. _skip:

skip
````

.. code-block:: haskell

  skip :: int -> Stream a -> Stream a

Discard the first *n* events from ``stream``. ::

  stream:          -a-b-c-d-e-f->
  skip(3, stream): -------d-e-f->

  stream:          -a-b-c-d-e|
  skip(3, stream): -------d-e|

  stream:          -a-b-c|
  skip(3, stream): ------|

If ``stream`` contains fewer than *n* events, the returned :ref:`Stream` will be empty.

.. _takeWhile:

takeWhile
`````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  takeWhile :: (a -> bool) -> Stream a -> Stream a

Keep all events until predicate returns ``false``, and discard the rest. ::

  stream:                  -2-4-5-6-8->
  takeWhile(even, stream): -2-4-|

.. _skipWhile:

skipWhile
`````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  skipWhile :: (a -> bool) -> Stream a -> Stream a

Discard all events until predicate returns ``false``, and keep the rest. ::

  stream:                  -2-4-5-6-8->
  skipWhile(even, stream): -----5-6-8->

.. _skipAfter:

skipAfter
`````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  skipAfter :: (a -> bool) -> Stream a -> Stream a

Discard all events after the first event for which predicate returns ``true``. ::

  stream:                  -1-2-3-4-5-6-8->
  skipAfter(even, stream): -1-2|

.. _until:

until
`````

.. code-block:: haskell

  until :: Stream * -> Stream a -> Stream a

Keep all events in one :ref:`Stream` until the first event occurs in another. ::

  stream:                   -a-b-c-d-e-f->
  endSignal:                ------z->
  until(endSignal, stream): -a-b-c|

Note that if ``endSignal`` has no events, then the returned :ref:`Stream` will effectively be equivalent to the original.

.. code-block:: javascript

  // Keep only 3 seconds of events, discard the rest.
  until(at(3000, null), stream)

.. _since:

since
`````

.. code-block:: haskell

  since :: Stream * -> Stream a -> Stream a

Discard all events in one :ref:`Stream` until the first event occurs in another. ::

  stream:                     -a-b-c-d-e-f->
  startSignal:                ------z->
  since(startSignal, stream): -------d-e-f->

Note that if ``startSignal`` has no events, then the returned :ref:`Stream` will effectively be equivalent to :ref:`never`.

.. code-block:: javascript

  // Discard events for 3 seconds, keep the rest.
  since(at(3000, null), stream)

.. _during:

during
``````

.. code-block:: haskell

  during :: Stream (Stream *) -> Stream a -> Stream a

Keep events that occur during a time window defined by a higher-order :ref:`Stream`. ::

  stream:                     -a-b-c-d-e-f-g->
  timeWindow:                 -----s
  s:                                -----x
  during(timeWindow, stream): -----c-d-e-|

This is similar to :ref:`slice`, but uses time rather than indices to "slice" the :ref:`Stream`.

.. code-block:: javascript

  // A time window that:
  // 1. starts at time = 1 second
  // 2. ends at time = 6 seconds (1 second + 5 seconds).
  const timeWindow = at(1000, at(5000, null))

  // 1. Discard events for 1 second, then
  // 2. keep events for 5 more seconds, then
  // 3. discard all subsequent events.
  during(timeWindow, stream)

.. _delay:

delay
`````

.. code-block:: haskell

  delay :: int -> Stream a -> Stream a

Timeshift a :ref:`Stream` by *n* milliseconds. ::

  stream:           -a-b-c-d->
  delay(1, stream): --a-b-c-d->
  delay(5, stream): ------a-b-c-d->

Delaying a :ref:`Stream` timeshifts all the events by the same amount. It doesn't change the time *between* events.

.. _throttle:

throttle
````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  throttle :: int -> Stream a -> Stream a

Limit the rate of events to at most one per *n* milliseconds. ::

  stream:               abcd----abcd---->
  throttle(2, stream):  a-c-----a-c----->

In contrast to :ref:`debounce`, ``throttle`` simply drops events that occur  "too often", whereas :ref:`debounce` waits for a "quiet period".

.. _debounce:

debounce
````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  debounce :: int -> Stream a -> Stream a

Wait for a burst of events to subside and keep only the last event in the burst. ::

  stream:              abcd----abcd---->
  debounce(2, stream): -----d-------d-->

If the :ref:`Stream` ends while there is a pending debounced event (e.g., via :ref:`until`), the pending event will occur just before the :ref:`Stream` ends. For example::

  s1:                         abcd----abcd---->
  s2:                         ------------|
  debounce(2, until(s2, s1)): -----d------d|

Debouncing can be extremely useful when dealing with bursts of similar events. For example, debouncing keypress events before initiating a remote search query in a browser application.

.. code-block:: javascript

  const searchInput = document.querySelector('[name="search-text"]');
  const searchText = most.fromEvent('input', searchInput);

  // The current value of the searchInput, but only
  // after the user stops typing for 500 milliseconds.
  map(e => e.target.value, debounce(500, searchText))

Dealing with Promises
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _fromPromise:

fromPromise
```````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  fromPromise :: Promise a -> Stream a

Create a :ref:`Stream` containing a promise's value. ::

  promise:              ----a
  fromPromise(promise): ----a|

If the promise rejects, the :ref:`Stream` will be in an error state with the promise's rejection reason as its error. See :ref:`recoverWith` for error recovery.

.. _awaitPromises:

awaitPromises
`````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  awaitPromises :: Stream (Promise a) -> Stream a

Turn a :ref:`Stream` of promises into a :ref:`Stream` containing the promises' values. ::

  promise p:             ---1
  promise q:             ------2
  promise r:             -3
  stream:                -p---q---r->
  awaitPromises(stream): ---1--2--3->

Note that order is always preserved, regardless of promise fulfillment order.

To create a :ref:`Stream` that merges promises in fulfillment order, use ``chain(fromPromise, stream)``. Note the difference::

  promise p:                    --1
  promise q:                    --------2
  promise r:                    ------3
  stream:                       -p-q-r----->
  chain(fromPromise, stream):   --1---3-2-->
  awaitPromises(stream):        --1-----23->

If a promise rejects, the :ref:`Stream` will be in an error state with the rejected promise's reason as its error. See :ref:`recoverWith` for error recovery. For example::

  promise p:             ---1
  promise q:             ------X
  promise r:             -3
  stream:                -p---q---r->
  awaitPromises(stream): ---1--X

Handling Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _recoverWith:

recoverWith
```````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  recoverWith :: (Error -> Stream a) -> Stream a -> Stream a

Recover from a stream failure by calling a function to create a new :ref:`Stream`. ::

  s:                 -a-b-c-X
  f(X):                     d-e-f->
  recoverWith(f, s): -a-b-c-d-e-f->

When ``s`` fails with an error, ``f`` will be called with the error. ``f`` must return a new :ref:`Stream` to replace the error.

Tasks
^^^^^

Helper functions for creating :ref:`Task`s to propagate events.

.. _propagateTask:

propagateTask
`````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  propagateTask :: (Time -> a -> Sink a -> *) -> a -> Sink a -> Task

Create a :ref:`Task` to propagate a value to a :ref:`Sink`. When the :ref:`Task` executes, the provided function will receive the current time (from the :ref:`Scheduler` with which it was scheduled) and the provided value and :ref:`Sink`.  The :ref:`Task` can use the :ref:`Sink` to propagate the value in whatever way it chooses. For example as an event or an error, or it could choose not to propagate the event based on some condition, etc.

.. _propagateEventTask:

propagateEventTask
``````````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  propagateEventTask :: a -> Sink a -> Task

Create a :ref:`Task` that can be scheduled to propagate an event value to a :ref:`Sink`. When the task executes, it will call the :ref:`Sink`'s ``event`` method with the current time (from the :ref:`Scheduler` with which it was scheduled) and the value.

.. _propagateEndTask:

propagateEndTask
````````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  propagateEndTask :: Sink * -> Task

Create a :ref:`Task` that can be scheduled to propagate end to a :ref:`Sink`. When the task executes, it will call the :ref:`Sink`'s ``end`` method with the current time (from the :ref:`Scheduler` with which it was scheduled).

.. _propagateErrorTask:

propagateErrorTask
``````````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  propagateErrorTask :: Error -> Sink * -> Task

Create a :ref:`Task` that can be scheduled to propagate an error to a :ref:`Sink`. When the :ref:`Task` executes, it will call the :ref:`Sink`'s ``error`` method with the current time (from the :ref:`Scheduler` with which it was scheduled) and the error.

Creating a Scheduler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _newScheduler:

newScheduler
````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  newScheduler :: Timer -> Timeline -> Scheduler

Create a new :ref:`Scheduler` that uses the provided :ref:`Timer` and :ref:`Timeline` for scheduling :ref:`Task`s.

.. _newDefaultScheduler:

newDefaultScheduler
```````````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  newDefaultScheduler :: () -> Scheduler

Create a new :ref:`Scheduler` that uses a default platform-specific :ref:`Timer` and a new, empty :ref:`Timeline`.

.. _Scheduler-relative:

schedulerRelativeTo
```````````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  schedulerRelativeTo :: Offset -> Scheduler -> Scheduler

Create a new :ref:`Scheduler` with origin (i.e., zero time) at the specified :ref:`Offset <Time>` with the provided :ref:`Scheduler`.

When implementing higher-order :ref:`Stream` combinators, this function can be used to create a :ref:`Scheduler` with local time for each "inner" :ref:`Stream`.

.. code-block:: javascript

  currentTime(scheduler) //> 1637
  const relativeScheduler = schedulerRelativeTo(1234, scheduler)
  currentTime(relativeScheduler) //> 0

  // ... later ...

  currentTime(scheduler) //> 3929
  currentTime(relativeScheduler) //> 2292

Timer, Timeline, and Clock
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _newClockTimer:

newClockTimer
`````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

Create an empty :ref:`Timeline`.

.. _newPlatformClock:

newPlatformClock
````````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  newPlatformClock :: () -> Clock

.. _newDateClock:

newDateClock
````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  newDateClock :: () -> Clock

Create a new :ref:`Clock` using ``Date.now``. Note that a :ref:`Clock` using ``Date.now`` is not guaranteed to be monotonic and is subject to system clock changes, e.g., NTP can change your system clock.

.. _clockRelativeTo:

clockRelativeTo
```````````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  clockRelativeTo :: Clock -> Clock

Create a new :ref:`Clock` whose origin is at the *current time* (at the instant of calling ``clockRelativeTime``) of the provided :ref:`Clock`.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _disposeNone:

disposeNone
```````````

.. code-block:: haskell

.. _ disposeWith:

disposeWith
```````````

.. code-block:: haskell

.. _disposeOnce:

disposeOnce
```````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  disposeOnce :: Disposable -> Disposable

Wrap a :ref:`Disposable` so the underlying :ref:`Disposable` will only be disposed of once—even if the returned :ref:`Disposable` is disposed of multiple times.

.. _disposeBoth:

disposeBoth
```````````

  disposeBoth :: Disposable -> Disposable -> Disposable

Combine two :ref:`Disposable`s into a single :ref:`Disposable` which will dispose of both.

.. _disposeAll:

disposeAll
``````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  disposeAll :: [Disposable] -> Disposable

Combine an array of :ref:`Disposable`s into a single :ref:`Disposable` which will dispose of all the :ref:`Disposable`s in the array.

.. _Disposing Disposables:

Disposing Disposables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _dispose:

dispose
```````

.. code-block:: haskell

  dispose :: Disposable -> void

Dispose of the provided :ref:`Disposable`. Note that ``dispose`` does not catch exceptions. If the :ref:`Disposable` throws an exception, the exception will propagate out of ``dispose``.

.. _tryDispose:

tryDispose
``````````

.. code-block:: haskell

  tryDispose :: Time -> Disposable -> Sink * -> void

Attempt to dispose of the provided :ref:`Disposable`. If the :ref:`Disposable` throws an exception, catch and propagate it to the provided :ref:`Sink` with the provided :ref:`Time`.

Note: Only an exception thrown by the :ref:`Disposable` will be caught. If the act of propagating an error to the :ref:`Sink` throws an exception, that exception *will not* be caught.
